What‚Äôs correct and solid (keep)

Receipt-based fast path fully aligns with our privacy-first architecture: verify receipt signature ‚Üí match proof_digest/policy_hash/constraint_hash ‚Üí check status bit ‚Üí done.

Revocation/suspension never overwritten during re-verify (prevents ‚Äúreactivate by re-verify‚Äù).

No full JWS storage by default (minimizes breach blast radius and keeps you GDPR-clean).

Abstraction via verifier_proof_ref means you can support ZK, JWS/LD-Proof, HW attestation, Merkle, blockchain proofs without schema churn.

Corrections / tightenings to apply (surgical)

These are small code/doc changes that materially raise security and audit quality.

Bind the entire status pointer

You already match statusListUrl + statusListIndex. Also match statusPurpose and normalize URL (scheme/host/port) before comparing. Reject on any mismatch.

JWT strictness

Enforce aud required (your registry DID/domain).

Enforce both nbf and exp with a bounded clock-skew (e.g., ¬±60s).

Require a jti (unique ID) and keep a short-TTL replay cache (5‚Äì15 min) to stop burst replays during validity windows.

Alg allow-list: accept only ES256 (and later EdDSA), reject anything else; disallow crit and alg: "none".

Digest rigor

Store digest algorithm next to proof_digest, validate length/encoding on ingest.

On fresh-crypto path, recompute digest from supplied bytes and must match the receipt‚Äôs proof_digest before running the verifier.

Fail-closed status

If the W3C Status List cannot be fetched or is stale beyond threshold, return verdict: "rejected" (or unknown) ‚Äî not ‚Äúverified‚Äù.

Implement ETag + If-None-Match caching and define max staleness (e.g., 24h prod; 1h high-risk policies).

Key handling (docs tweak)

In Registry env: verification-only with VERIFIER_JWKS_URL (public JWKS).

Never log private keys; if dev keys are auto-generated, ensure dev-only behavior and suppress private material from logs.

Policy-gated freshness

Wire requiresFreshProof(policy_hash) to a real policy store (by CID).

Consider ‚Äútime since last verify‚Äù policy (e.g., >30 days ‚Üí fresh proof required).

Fresh path must discard proof bytes after verification (no persistence).

Telemetry privacy

Redact tokens/receipts from logs. Log only opaque ids (proof_asset_id), policy_hash, constraint_hash, statusVerdict, and trace_id.

Repo hygiene & structure recommendations

If any of these aren‚Äôt yet committed, I recommend moving them from ‚Äúattached_assets‚Äù into proper code paths.

Tests you should see/commit

Receipt substitution: mismatch in statusListUrl / statusListIndex / statusPurpose ‚Üí reject.

Revoked stays revoked: any re-verify on revoked/suspended ‚Üí remains blocked.

JWT rejections: missing/invalid aud, expired exp, not-yet-valid nbf, unrecognized alg, missing jti.

Status fail-closed: simulate status fetch outage ‚Üí rejected/unknown.

Fresh path SRI: proof_uri fetch where digest ‚â† proof_digest ‚Üí reject before verifier runs.

Canonicalization stability: identical JSON with different key order ‚Üí same commitment digest.

Quick wins I can ship next

A /reverify unit test file covering all branches above.

A status list client with ETag handling and staleness thresholds.

A policy store (by policy_cid) with a flag requireFreshProof + time windows.

A one-pager ‚ÄúPartner Conformance Suite‚Äù (10 JSON examples) so partners can self-test receipts & status.

Bottom line

‚úÖ Your repo is visible and correctly targeted for MyProof Registry.

‚úÖ The receipt-based approach and the two security fixes are correct and strong.

üîí Apply the tightenings above (aud/nbf/exp/jti, statusPurpose compare, SRI, fail-closed status, no private key logging) to hit A-grade security and regulator-friendly posture.
