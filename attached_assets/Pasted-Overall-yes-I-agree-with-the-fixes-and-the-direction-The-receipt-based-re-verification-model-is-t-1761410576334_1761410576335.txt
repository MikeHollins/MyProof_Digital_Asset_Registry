Overall: yes, I agree with the fixes and the direction. The receipt-based re-verification model is the right privacy-first pattern, and your two concrete patches (status_ref binding and revocation bypass prevention) close the biggest holes. I’d keep them — with a few surgical corrections/tightenings below to make the flow bullet-proof and regulator-friendly.

Keep (good as-is)

Fast-path re-verify via signed receipt (no proof bytes stored).

Bind to immutable commitments: proof_digest, policy_hash, constraint_hash.

Respect revocation/suspension and never “reactivate” on re-verify.

ES256 + JWKS with kid and rotation workflow.

Tighten (small but important)

Compare all status fields
You’re already checking statusListUrl and statusListIndex. Also compare:

statusPurpose (must equal revocation / suspension exactly)

Normalization: trim and lowercase host in statusListUrl before compare; reject if URL normalization changes meaning (e.g., different scheme/port).

Enforce JWT audience/expiry strictly

Require aud to equal your service (domain or DID) and reject if absent.

Enforce both nbf and exp. Treat clock skew explicitly (e.g., ±60s max).

Add jti + replay cache

Have the verifier include a unique jti in the receipt; maintain a short-TTL replay cache (e.g., 5–15 min). This prevents high-frequency replay within the valid window.

Alg allow-list + JOSE header checks

Reject everything except your allow-list (e.g., ES256 now, consider EdDSA later).

Ensure typ is as expected (e.g., JWT) and no crit headers you don’t support.

Explicitly disallow "alg":"none" or unexpected parameters.

Digest rigor

Persist the digest algorithm alongside proof_digest and check length/encoding on ingest and verify.

On fresh-crypto path, recompute digest from provided proof bytes and require exact match with the receipt’s proof_digest before running verifier logic.

Fail-closed status checks

If the W3C Status List is unreachable, return verdict:"rejected" (or unknown) rather than “verified.”

Cache lists with ETag/If-None-Match and set a max staleness window; if stale beyond threshold, fail closed.

Key handling correction (docs)

Your note says: if no env keys are provided, generate and log keys to console. Keep the generation dev-only and never log the private key.

In production, the registry should only verify receipts (public JWKS). Signature issuance belongs in the verifier service with KMS/HSM.

Policy-gated freshness

Your doc describes freshness; ensure the code path respects a policy flag (e.g., requireFreshProof=true) or a time-since-last-verify threshold (e.g., >30 days → force fresh proof).

On fresh path, do not persist the proof bytes; verify then discard.

Telemetry privacy

Redact receipt/token contents in logs. Keep only opaque IDs, policy_hash, constraint_hash, statusVerdict, and trace_id.

Optional (nice to have, future-proof)

Ed25519/EdDSA support alongside ES256 to increase crypto agility.

kid pinning to a trust list per tenant/partner.

Unit tests:

receipt substitution (mismatch status url/index/purpose),

revoked/suspended remain blocked,

expired/nbf rejections,

unreachable status list → fail closed,

digest mismatch on fresh path.

Tiny doc edits I recommend

In your Environment Configuration, split roles explicitly:

Registry: VERIFIER_JWKS_URL (public), no private key.

Verifier service (separate component): RECEIPT_SIGNING_KEY (private, KMS/HSM).

In “Security Properties,” add Replay Resistance with jti + nonce cache.

In “Status List Check,” state fail-closed behavior and max staleness window.

Bottom line

Agree with how you applied the two main fixes — they’re correct and important.

Make the small corrections above (statusPurpose compare, strict aud/exp/nbf/jti, alg allow-list, digest rigor, fail-closed status, dev-only key gen w/ no private-key logging).

With those tightened, the re-verification flow is A-grade: privacy-preserving, secure, and audit-ready.
